            <p>Hello! I’m a passionate software developer with over 11 years of experience in iOS, PHP, and Java
                development. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in building robust and user-friendly applications, and
                I’m now eager to explore remote opportunities that allow me to contribute to innovative projects while
                continuing to grow professionally.</p>

            <p>Here’s a quick overview of my expertise:</p>

            <li>2 years of iOS development: Proficient in Swift and Objective-C, with experience in building and
                maintaining mobile applications.</li>

            <li>3 years of PHP development: Skilled in backend development, creating dynamic web applications, and
                working with databases.</li>

            <li>6 years of Java development: Extensive experience in building scalable, high-performance applications
                and working with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.</li>

            <p>While I’m fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, I’m currently working on improving my English proficiency to
                expand my opportunities in the global job market. To achieve this, I’m seeking part-time roles that
                allow me to practice English in a professional setting while contributing my technical skills.</p>

            Outside of work, I enjoy singing, playing badminton, and using Duolingo to learn new languages. I’m also
            deeply interested in learning sign language to support and empower individuals in need, as I believe in
            using technology and communication to make a positive impact on society.

            I’m excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities where I can contribute my
            technical expertise while continuing to grow both personally and professionally. Let’s connect and create
            something amazing together!
