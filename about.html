            <p>Hello. This is Ron. I was born in Guangdong, China. I’m fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, but I need to improve my English to expand my opportunities in the global job market. To achieve this, I’m seeking part-time roles that allow me to practice English professionally while contributing my technical skills.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Actually, I’m a passionate software developer with over 11 years of experience in iOS, PHP, and Java development. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in building robust and user-friendly applications. I’m now eager to explore remote opportunities that allow me to contribute to innovative projects while continuing to grow professionally.</p>

            <p>Here’s a quick overview of my expertise:</p>

            <li>2 years of iOS development: Proficient in Swift and Objective-C, with experience building and maintaining mobile applications.</li>

            <li>3 years of PHP development: Skilled in backend development, creating dynamic web applications, and working with databases.</li>

            <li>6 years of Java development: Extensive experience in building scalable, high-performance applications and working with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, .etc</li>

            <br/>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy singing, playing badminton, and using Duolingo to learn English. I’m also deeply interested in learning sign language to support and empower individuals in need, as I believe in using technology and communication to positively impact society.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>I’m excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities where I can contribute my
            technical expertise while continuing to grow both personally and professionally. Let’s connect and create
            something amazing together!</p>
