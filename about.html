            <p>Hello. This is Ron. I am born in Guangdong, China. So I’m fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, but English is need to improve for expanding my opportunities in the global job market. To achieve this, I’m seeking <b>part-time roles</b> that allow me to practice English in a professional setting while contributing my technical skills.</p>

            <p>Actually, I’m a passionate software developer with over 11 years of experience in iOS, PHP, and Java development. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in building robust and user-friendly applications, and I’m now eager to explore remote opportunities that allow me to contribute to innovative projects while continuing to grow professionally.</p>

            <p>Here’s a quick overview of my expertise:</p>

            <li>2 years of iOS development: Proficient in Swift and Objective-C, with experience in building and
                maintaining mobile applications.</li>

            <li>3 years of PHP development: Skilled in backend development, creating dynamic web applications, and
                working with databases.</li>

            <li>6 years of Java development: Extensive experience in building scalable, high-performance applications
                and working with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.</li>

            Outside of work, I enjoy singing, playing badminton, and using Duolingo to learn new languages. I’m also
            deeply interested in learning sign language to support and empower individuals in need, as I believe in
            using technology and communication to make a positive impact on society.

            I’m excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities where I can contribute my
            technical expertise while continuing to grow both personally and professionally. Let’s connect and create
            something amazing together!
