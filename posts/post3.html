            <h2>The car dating circle system</h2>
            <p>Published on: <time datetime="2021-12-14">December 14, 2021</time></p>
            <p>This is a car dating circle client used by overseas Chinese in Canada; the backend management includes user management, topic management, car dating circle management, store management, broker management, vehicle management, operation management, etc.</p>
            <p>Technology stack and difficulties: The Spring boot 2.1 framework is used as the backend, and Vue.js 2.6 is used as the front-end and backend management pages; the difficulty is to synchronize the vehicle data module and the car selection search module. Since the vehicle data needs to be synchronized with a third-party interface, I first obtain all vehicle brands, and the number is approximately 40, using asynchronous batch execution, ensuring thread safety through redis, retaining a field to record whether the synchronization is complete, and then calling the interface brand by brand, inserting mysql in batches, executing all brands in a loop, and finally modifying the field to be complete. Several car configuration parameters in the car selection search module require full-text fuzzy search. I synchronized the vehicle data in mysql to the Elasticsearch system. After all vehicle information is synchronized with mysql, I immediately start the Elasticsearch synchronization, which can greatly optimize the search speed.</p>
