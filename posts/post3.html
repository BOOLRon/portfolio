                <p>The PHP department was closed after 3 years due to the company's business transformation, and the Java department was established. I have been engaged in Java development for over 6 years, which opened my String life.</p>

            <h2>The car dating circle system</h2>
            <p>Published on: <time datetime="2021-12-14">December 14, 2021</time></p>
            <p>This car dating circle client is used by overseas Chinese in Canada; the backend management module includes users, topics, car dating circles, stores, brokers, vehicles, operations, and other modules.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Technology stack and difficulties: The Spring boot 2.1 framework is used as the backend, and Vue.js 2.6 is used as the front-end and backend management pages; the difficulty is in synchronizing the vehicle data module and the car selection search module. At first, I obtained all vehicle brands since the vehicle data needs to be synchronized with a third-party interface. The number is approximately 40, using asynchronous batch execution, ensuring thread safety through Redis, retaining a field to record whether the synchronization is complete, and then calling the interface brand by brand, inserting MySQL in batches, executing all brands in a loop, and finally modifying the field to be complete. Several car configuration parameters in the car selection search module require full-text fuzzy search. I synchronized the vehicle data in MySQL to the Elasticsearch system. After synchronizing all vehicle information with MySQL, I immediately start the Elasticsearch synchronization, which can significantly optimize the search speed.</p>
