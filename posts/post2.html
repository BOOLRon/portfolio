                <p>In a company developed for 2 years iOS, the technical director thinks I have good learning ability, has been working as a client side development unfortunately, suggested that I transfer to the backend, and then I started a 3-year PHP travel.</p>

            <p>This is an online shopping platform that provides a variety of consumer products and supports users to purchase online. As one of the main backend developers, I am responsible for the implementation and maintenance of core functions such as order processing, payment interface integration, and inventory management. For example, when a user places an order, we do not need to execute all processing logic immediately, but push the task to Queues. In this way, the user's response will not be slowed down due to back-end processing, ensuring a good user experience. For some time-consuming background operations, such as sending a large number of email notifications, updating inventory status, making price changes, etc., the Queues system is also used to handle it. In this way, these tasks can be processed in batches without affecting the user operations in the foreground and the response speed of the management interface in the background.</p>
