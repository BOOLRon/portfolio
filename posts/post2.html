                <p>In a company that had been developing iOS for 2 years, the technical director thought I had good learning ability, and it would be a pity if I kept developing the client. He suggested that I switch to the backend. From then on, I started my 3-year PHP journey.</p>

            <p>This online shopping platform provides a variety of consumer products and supports users in making online purchases. As one of the leading back-end developers, I am responsible for implementing and maintaining core functions such as order processing, payment interface integration, and inventory management. For example, when a user places an order, we do not need to execute all processing logic immediately but push the task to Queues. This way, the user's response will not be slowed down due to back-end processing, ensuring a good user experience. The Queues system is also used to handle some time-consuming background operations, such as sending many email notifications, updating inventory status, making price changes, etc. This way, these tasks can be processed in batches without affecting the user operations in the foreground and the response speed of the management interface in the background.</p>
